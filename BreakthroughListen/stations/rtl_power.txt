Using rtl_power to Perform a Scan of Frequency Bandwidths

A radio dongle (here a RTL2838) is used to receive signals from nearby radio stations. rtl_power is a program created by reddit user keenerd to be used software defined radio devices to scan frequency bandwidths.

Command:
rtl_power -f Min:Max:bin filename.type

Min to Max frequency is the range in which the scan takes place; bin is the frequency interval separating each data point.

Using the dongle to scan FM radio stations (ranging from 87.9 to 107.9 MHz), I performed the following scan:

rtl_power -f 87M:108M:1k -g 20 -i 10 -e 15m logfile.csv

Parameters:
g: gain
i: time interval for each scan
e: total scan period
