\section{Final Project Abstract and Figures}
Recent scientific efforts have observed ejection of ice plumes from the
south polar region of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. The likelihood of the
existence of cryovolcanoes inside Enceladus along with planetary
modeling along with other evidence suggests the presence of a liquid
water ocean beneath the Enceladus. How likely is it for such an ocean to
actually exist and can Enceladus live up to its name as the prime
candidate for possibly hosting extraterrestrial life?
