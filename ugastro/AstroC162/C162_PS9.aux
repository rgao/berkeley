\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces This diagram aims to explain the mechanism behind possible cryovolcanism and subsurface ocean. Tidal heating in the mantle, which can give rise to a geologically active subsurface world, likely exists due to Enceladus' position relative to Saturn and other moons of Saturn. The resulting circulation would produce the conditions for a liquid ocean water between the icy crust and the molten mantle. Source: Wikipedia}}{2}}
