\section{Final Project Abstract and Figures}
Recent scientific efforts have observed ejection of ice plumes from
geysers in the south polar region of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. The
likelihood of the existence of cryovolcanoes inside Enceladus along with
planetary modeling along with other lines evidence suggests the presence
of a liquid water ocean beneath the Enceladus. How likely is it for such
an ocean to actually exist and can Enceladus live up to its name as the
prime candidate for possibly hosting extraterrestrial life?

  discovered by the Cassini-Huygens probe in 2005. The false-color lines
  denote the locations of the geysers from which ice was shown being
  spewn out and where ice and simple organic carbon compounds have been
  detected. Source: Wikipedia}

\caption{This diagram aims to explain the mechanism the cryovolcanism
  and that which would allow a subsurface ocean. Tidal heating in the
  mantle of Enceladus likely exists for Enceladus due to its position
  relative to Saturn and other moons of Saturn and would explain the
  likely geologically active nature of Enceladus' subsurface world. The
  resulting circulation would produce the conditions for a liquid ocean
  water between the icy crust and the molten mantle. Source: Wikipedia}

c. Astronomers used the radial velocities of early dust clouds,
illuminated by background quasars, to determine the rate of expansion,
with relative accuracy, of the universe when gravity was deccelerating
the expansion rate.
