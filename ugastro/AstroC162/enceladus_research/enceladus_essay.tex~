\section{Introduction}
Enceladus is an icy world orbiting Saturn and, from recent observations,
may be a new frontier for space exploration and astrophysical
research. It is a relatively small moon with a cross sectional size of
England's area. Despite its small size, it is uniquely interesting as
the first body discovered to have ice jets shooting from geyser-like
openings. Does Enceladus in fact have a subsurface ocean and one that is
capable of hosting life? Based on direct observations and numerical
analyses, it is very likely that Enceladus have a reservoir of liquid
water beneath its icy crust.
\section{The South Polar Region}
Very little was known about Enceladus until 2005, when the
Cassini-Huygens spacecraft imaged details of Enceladus' surface for the
first time. Enceladus featured a region, later to be known as the 'tiger
stripes,' in the southern hemisphere where water ice jets seem to be
erupting from. Whereas most of Enceladus' surface is composed of
granular fine ice, the site of the cryovolcanic activities are primarily
composed of crystalline ice due to geological activity and higher
temperature. The south polar region is also the location of a detected
hemisphere, which formed from the material ejected by the jets. Analyses
concluded that the atmosphere is composed of approximately 91 percent
water vapor and is a major source of Saturn's E Ring. The peculiarities
of these region indicates a differentiated body and the existence of a
subsurface ocean inside the southern hemisphere. 
\section{Cryovolcanism and Internal Mechanisms}
The observed cryovolcanic activities are indicative of an active
interior. A form is heating mechanicsm would most likely be necessary to
maintain a subsurface liquid water ocean, if such an ocean is indeed
responsible for the ice jets.

Tidal heating can easily be present to provide the necessary energy
source that would support the ocean. Tidal forces on Enceladus arise
from its interaction with nearby bodies such as Saturn and Dione. The
thermal energy from the tidal forces can differentiate the interior by
heating up the mantle, creating a bed of magma. Such an active interior
generate energy circulation upwards towards the surface. Between the
water ice crush and the magma mantle would be a layer in which
temperatures and conditions would favor the existence of a liquid water
ocean. This active ocean would in turn release energy through cracks in
the form of the observed cryovolcanic activities, releasing water ice
among other substances. Organic compounds such as methane, propane,
acetylene, and other hydrocarbons have been detected near areas with
cryovolcanic activity.
